/**
 * Given an array of integers between 1 and n, inclusive, where n is the length of the array, write a function that
 * returns the first integer that appears more than once (when the array is read from left to right).
 * <p>
 * In other words, out of all the integers that might occur more than once in the input array, your function should
 * return the one whose first duplicate value has the minimum index.
 * <p>
 * If no integer appears more than once, your function should return -1.
 *
 * <p>Note that you're allowed to mutate the input array.</p>
 * <h3>Sample Input #1</h3>
 * array = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]
 *
 * <h3>Sample Output #1</h3>
 * 2 // 2 is the first integer that appears more than once. // 3 also appears more than once, but the second 3 appears
 * after the second 2.
 *
 * <h3>Sample Input #2</h3>
 * array = [2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4]
 * <h3>Sample Output #2</h3>
 * 3 // 3 is the first integer that appears more than once. // 2 also appears more than once, but the second 2 appears
 * after the second 3.
